<!-- Enough commercial and self promotion, lets get to the topic-->

# Overview
* Spline

  * Explanation & Demonstration
  * Implementation
  * Inferences
  
* Advance Topics

  * Penalized spline
  * Multivariate spline

# Objectives
* To review the basic concepts of spline

* To raise you awareness of other advanced spline applications 

<!-- primarily R user, Hence, less familiar of spline implementation in other softwares -->

# Spline

## Motivation
> "It is extremely unlikely that the true function f(X) is actually linear in X."

<!-- For example, the realtionship between age and COVID mortality. -->

## Previous Solutions:

* Variable categorization: e.g. using quartiles of a continuous variable in a model

  * Assuming all subjects within a group shares the same risk/effect
  * Different magnitude of effects around thresholds
  
  
* Polynomial regression:
  $$
  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2 x^2 + \dots + \beta_mx^m + \epsilon
  $$
  * Precision issues, e.g. $x$ is blood pressure measure, and $x^3$ would be extremely large
  * Goodness of fit: deciding which order of polynomial term should be included

## Spline
* A spline is a piece-wise function where each piece is a polynomial function of order $m$

* AKA semi-parametric regression, non-parametric regression, (generalized) additive model

<!-- buzz word for grant writing. Little niche here, semi-parametric and non-parametric regression could be a little broader concept. -->
* Can be easily incorporated in linear regression, generalized linear regression, Cox regression

## Spline Components
* Order/degree of the polynomial function, $m$

  * Normally, $m=3$ is sufficient

* Number of knots, $k$, & their placements

  * By default, equally spaced

* Basis functions: 
  * different representations of the spline that have specific mathematical properties
  * e.g. b-splines basis, Gaussian radial basis, etc.

## Spline Example

A spline of order 0 with 2 knots

\begin{equation*}
  \hat{y} = 
  \begin{cases}
  2, & x \leq 1 \\
  1.2, & 1 < x \leq 5\\
  1.5, & x > 5
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
  <!-- This is the business of column space force, aka linear algebra mathematicians. -->

## Visual Demonstration

## Natural Cubic Spline
* Cubic polynomial in each piece-wise function, i.e. m = 3

* Great mathematical properties

  * The smoothest possible interpolant
  
* Many different representations:

  * Restricted cubic spline
  * Cubic B-spline

## Implementation
Given a response $Y$ and a variable $X$, implementing a cubic B-spline with 5 knots

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(splines)  # Package for b-spline

x_spline <- bs(x, degree = 3, # cubic polynomial
               df = 8)   # 5 (df-degree) knots         
glm(y ~ x_spline) # Fitting the spline model

# Equivalently
glm(y ~ bs(x, degree=3, df=8))
```

## Variability Band

* A delicate statistical problem

* Most commonly used: point-wise 95% confidence interval

* Can be calculate using statistical contrasts

## Hypothesis Testing

* Two hypothesis tests

  * If the non-linear terms are necessary
  * If the variable is necessary in the model

* Be careful when reading program manual


# Advanced Topics
## Penalized Spline
* Motivation: 
   * To simplify the decision making about the knots

* Idea: 
  * Set the number of knots to a really large value (k=25, 40, $N$)
  * Use variable selection methods, penalized models specifically, to decide the smoothness of the spline
  
* Complication & extension:
  * Complicated hypothesis testing and interval inference
  * Bayesian generalized additive model, generalized additive mixed model

## Multivariate Splines
* Model the non-linear interaction between two variables

* Thin-plate regression splines, tensor product splines

* Application: 
  * Loop, M. S., Howard, G., de Los Campos, G., Al-Hamdan, M. Z., Safford, M. M., Levitan, E. B., & McClure, L. A. (2017). Heat maps of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking in the continental United States. __Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, 10(1), e003350.__

# Conclusion
* Reviewed concepts of spline

* New insight of advanced spline models

* __Consult with statisticians when feeling not comfortable doing spline models__
